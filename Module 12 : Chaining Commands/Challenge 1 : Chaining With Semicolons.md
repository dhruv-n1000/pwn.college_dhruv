# CHaining With Semicolons
This challenge requires us to use the ';' to chain 2 different commands.
## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{kWkLkkOSCJxbFlKpDwNeOLroz8B.QX1UDO0wSOxkjNzEzW}'

In this challenge, we simply had to use ';' to chain 2 different executions.
```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kWkLkkOSCJxbFlKpDwNeOLroz8B.QX1UDO0wSOxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learn
I learnt that we can use ';' to chain 2 different commands so that the execution can be done in a single line rather than 2 different lines.
## References
None.
