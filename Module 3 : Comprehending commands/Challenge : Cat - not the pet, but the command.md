# Cat : not the pet, but the command.
The challenge requires us to use the 'cat' command to read out files. In this case the flag for the challenge would be stored in a file called flag.
## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{EwD95rRLVijeVbXy0NkGgq37eGx.QXxcTN0wSOxkjNzEzW}'

In this challenge, We simply had to use the 'cat' command to view the contents of the file 'flag' which was containing the flag we needed to pass the challenge.
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat ~/flag
pwn.college{EwD95rRLVijeVbXy0NkGgq37eGx.QXxcTN0wSOxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt that we use the 'cat' command to read the contents stored in a particular file, also cat command can be used to concatenate the contents of various files by using the format 'cat file 1 file2' ( here it first displays file1 content followed by file 2 content ).
