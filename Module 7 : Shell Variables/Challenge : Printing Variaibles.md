# Printing Variables
This challenge requires us to use 'echo' command with '$' to help print the value contained in the variable.
## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{8Ru9uMB7JkSPRoyvPW8r5sjgFgZ.QX3UTN0wSOxkjNzEzW}'

In this challenge, we simply had to use'echo' command with '$' to help print the value contained in the variable 'FLAG'.
```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{8Ru9uMB7JkSPRoyvPW8r5sjgFgZ.QX3UTN0wSOxkjNzEzW}
```
