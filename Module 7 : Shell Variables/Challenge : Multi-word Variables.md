# Multiword Variables
This challenge requires us to use Assign a variable multiword value.
## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{c-G5gdJ01pmoQW_lSombslfjpgQ.QXwYTN0wSOxkjNzEzW}'

In this challenge, we simply had to use "" to enclose the group of words 'COLLEGE YEAH' to assign it value to a variable 'PWN'.
```
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{c-G5gdJ01pmoQW_lSombslfjpgQ.QXwYTN0wSOxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learn
I learnt that we can put the words in "" to assign their value to a variable. 
## References
None.
