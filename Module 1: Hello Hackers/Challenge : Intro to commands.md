# Intro To commands
The challenge asks you to link local terminal to pwn.college using ssh and invoke the hello command in the terminal.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{kv_NR4ttmvfvzPwEoa9zHQ7XH03.QX3YjM1wSOxkjNzEzW}'

In this level, we invoke the hello command to get the flag, Keeping in mind that commands in Linux are case sensitive that is 'hello' is different from 'HELLO'.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kv_NR4ttmvfvzPwEoa9zHQ7XH03.QX3YjM1wSOxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how Linux commands can be typed in local terminal and connected to pwn.college via ssh.
## References
None.
