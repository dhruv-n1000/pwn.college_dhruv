# Command History
The challenge asks you to check the history for every command we have invoked in the past and use the up/down key to grab a previously invoked command.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{ARJIuyFvdvozLGDog1GmGztWbmQ.0lNzEzNxwSOxkjNzEzW}'

First we type a certain command in the terminal, then if we ever need that piece of command again, we can navigate to the previous command using up/down arrow as we have done in the code
```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{ARJIuyFvdvozLGDog1GmGztWbmQ.0lNzEzNxwSOxkjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how Linux commands can be reused by using the up/down key to navigate between the previous commands in history.

## References
None.
